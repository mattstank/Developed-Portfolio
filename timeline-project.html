                    <li> <span class="date">Year of 1994:</span>The first work on style sheets started at CERN.</li>
                    <li><span class="date">December 1996:</span> CSS was proposed as W3C standard:
                        <blockquote> "CSS1 defines the language in which style sheets are written and a set of properties that designers can use to describe how documents should be presented. The properties in CSS1 cover the most common screen-based presentations."</blockquote></li>
                    <li><span class="date">November 1997:</span> The W3C released the first public CSS2 Working Draft. New features:</li>
                        <ul>
        
                            <li>Ability to specify how a document should be spoken when rendering HTML with a speech synthesizer.</li>
                                <ul> 
                                    <li>You can specify how loudly a phrase should be spoken, where pauses should be, voice characteristics, and where one speaker is physically in relation to others (for stereo effects </li>
                                    <li>You can insert sound clips before and after elements, for instance, to emphasize hypertext links.</li>  
                                </ul>
                            
                            <li>More complex positioning of text, images and other elements on the page.</li>
                                <ul> 
                                    <li>You can position text in a box within a paragraph.</li>
                                    <li>You can position and "layer" material as though it was written on acetate sheets one on top of each other: most kinds of layout which are commonly found in magazines and other printed material are possible with CSS2.</li>
                                </ul>
                            
                            <li>You can specify styles for printing and other media.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stylesheet for printing on paper may need to be different from one for presenting information on a screen.</li>
                                    <li>CSS2 lets authors associate different stylesheets for different media with the same document.</li>
                                    <li>Authors can control page breaks.</li>
                                    <li>Has widow and orphan control, just as for ordinary desktop publishing.</li>
                                    <li>For high-quality printing, crop marks can be printed outside the outer edges of the page box.</li>
                                </ul>
                            
                            <li>Better specification of fonts for a document.</li>
                                <ul>

                            <li><span class="date">2000:</span> Work on CSS3 was under way.
                                    <blockquote>"CSS3 will, in effect, have all of the features that users expect from a desktop publishing environment, as well as a range of features especially suited to the context of an international and multimedia Web. CSS3 will also be modularized."</blockquote></li>
